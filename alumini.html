<center> MAULANA AZAD NATIONAL INSTITTE OF TECHNOLOGY</CENTER><br>
Alumni are the basic constituent and important stakeholders of any higher educational institute. Alumni are life-long family members of the institute and constitute a great force by virtue of their wisdom, innovative minds and ideas, working in the diverse fields at various geographical locations across the world. As its esteemed alumni, you are also aware that Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology is one of the leading institutions of national importance in the area of technical education, which was formerly known as Maulana Azad college of Technology (MACT). MANIT/MACT has produced many technocrats, entrepreneurs, scientists, role models etc in last many years.
MANIT, Bhopal recognizes the potential role that an alumnus can play in fostering its growth and thus initiates an ‘MANIT/MACT Alumni Coordination Cell’, a central body that would commence and coordinate all alumni activities. The cell encourages the alumni to take abiding interest in the progress and development of Alma Mater. By establishing this cell, I also offer my sincere gratitude to the students of Alma Mater and I wish that our relationship foster strongly in the coming future. I look forward to your valuable thoughts on how you can contribute in this endeavor by sparing some of your valuable time and expertise to the benefit of your Alma Mater and to the community at large.
I once again would like to thank you and hope to receive positive feedbacks very soon.
Director, MANIT. .
